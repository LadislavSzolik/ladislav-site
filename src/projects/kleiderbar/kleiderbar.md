## Define the brief

- **Client:** Owner of a children clothes second-hand shop.
- **Problem statement:** Paper only inventory system requires time and effort to maintain. This often leads to stress and loss of clients.
- **The goal:** Create an inventory system which helps my client to easily receive, sell and return second-hand goods
- **Timeline:** The client had no specific timeline.
- **Team**: I was a sole designer & developer, responsible for product discovery together with the client.
- **Deliverables**: Native iOS prototype app with key features

## Initial concepts

### Challenges

- The client uses digital devices only for basic tasks (calls, instant messages)
- It was hard for her to imagine the mobile app from a picture in inVision

### Solutions

In the first prototype I validated the followings:

- Manually enter customer details
- Add clothes types from list
- Scan the printed QR-code to pair it with the received clothes.

### Leasons learned

It is not sufficient to print only the QR-code as clothes label. The client uses label information for orientation, e.g. date of arrival, size, customer.

## Iterations

### Capture new items

We focused on the capture flow as it has many different interaction points. We tested three different concepts to discover the most efficient way to perform this task.

### Leasons learned

From the interviews and the usability test observations I learned that most important part of clientâ€™s workflow is quickly recording all the received clothes. The number of newly arrived clothes can be really high (100). In the next iterations I was trying to make this step as easy as possible.

## Results

### The problem with mobile apps

In the end of the design process we discovered that the client does not feel comfortable using a mobile phone to manage her business. One of the core reason is the lack of trusing technology.

### Simplified workflow

Still our effort was not wasted as we disocvered a simpler label printing method.

> It was an interesting procedure. I never thought that I will also learn so much about my work and to find problems about which I was not aware.
