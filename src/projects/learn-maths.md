## Introduction

### Problem statment

- It is common not only in Switzerland, but in many other countries that elementary students face a lot of challenges with mathematics. This situation results in ignorance and losing of interesting in the subject.
- The goal of the project is to enable children visualise and practice common mathematical challenges

### Role(s) played

- UX Designer, Frontend Engineer

### Activities performed

- Ideation workshops
- Wire-framing
- Design High-fidelity mockups (using SketchApp)
- Develop interactive prototype for Tablet devices

### Links

- Live demo site: https://maths-on-tablet.netlify.app/
- Github code: https://github.com/LadislavSzolik/maths-lessons-typescript

## Research

### Initial hypothesis

1. Parents are open to try out online solution, which is addition to the class lessons.
2. With better visualisation and interactivity children will be able to grasp maths faster.
3. Parents would like to have better overview about how their children improves in maths.

### Market research

- We found many general apps for maths
- We conducted interviews with local teachers and parents to get better understanding about the situation
- Our identified market opportunity was the additional metrics about the students performance

### Personas

- **Lisa** The parent, who wants her child to succeed. She keeps herself informed about new studying methods.
- **Rafael** The 4th grade student, who struggles to understand subtractions with multi-digit number.

## Early designs

- In the team we had one person who worked previously as a teacher. His domain knowledge and connections gave us insights which we could incorporate into the application.
- We started with the scope of the exercises. These specifications were minimalistic and produced with the help of Google Docs. Our goal was to narrow the concepts we want to cover.

_First wireframe with the exercise overview_

- Once we had the scope, we ideated on the different type of exercises. For example how might we make fun adding numbers together.

_Defining the different types of exercises_

### Lessons learned

- Having somebody with domain knowledge reduces the feedback loop and allowed us to move fast.

## Iterations

- Each exercise was first designed using Sketchapp, shared with the team and implemented as clickable prototype.

_Showcasing different type of exercises_

### Lessons learned

- The first usability tests revealed that for an app (like ours) with rich interactions, the static screen based prototype produced less insights than the later developed clickable prototype.

## Conclusion

The product did not evolve further than a prototype due to multiple factors:

1. We havenâ€™t got support from the school system
2. Interviews with parents revealed the lack of interest in investing into a solution like this.
3. The team had a challenge to continue working on the project.

This project helped me to develop my design and front end engineering skills. It though me how to rapidaly create clickable prototypes, and to learn what functionality is enough to get results.
