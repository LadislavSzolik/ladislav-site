## Before coding
- create designs to try out different spacing, size, font, etc. Otherwise playing around with size in code can lead to infinite loop

## Images
- standardise image sizes so you don't need to pass width and height as param
- Figma design tool has the Cut feature, which allows you to cut a specific size. It make sense to establish a template
- use description text for the hero image alt text 

## Project page structure
- Markdown content make sense
- At the moment you include HTML in markdown, all children nodes need to be HTMLs 
- It is possible to convert Markdown to HTML to avoid problems

## Solution with Attributes and divs
- they were dirty, not that nice
