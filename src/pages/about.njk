  <h1 class="page__title">About</h1>
  <p>I am coming from a small village in Slovakia called Kamenicna (Keszegfalva). It is located at the border of Slovakia and Hungary, therefore I speak both languages, plus German and of course, English.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>I consider myself a technologist and phylospher. It means I like to learn new technologies and I believe they can improve our lifes. But on the other hand, I know it is not all sunshine and happiness. The question what keeps me thinking, what is the right balance and where we are heading right now.</p>
