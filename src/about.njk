  <h1 class="header-1">About me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I’m Ladislav Szolik — a UX designer and Software Engineer based in Zürich, Switzerland.</p>
  <p>
    I’ve spent the last decade working across the entire product lifecycle — from early concept validation to launching
    full-scale web applications. I’ve designed and delivered experiences for major brands like Swisscom, Credit Suisse
    (today UBS), and Ärztekasse, and began my career in software engineering at Accenture.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    I believe good design is practical, honest, and focused on real people. Whether you’re launching a new product or
    improving an existing one, I bring a collaborative, thoughtful approach to every project.
  </p>
