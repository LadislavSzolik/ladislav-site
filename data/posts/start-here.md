# Who is it for?

- Aspiring software developers or ux designers living or moving to Switzerland, who feel confused and overwhelmed about their career
- Professionals, who want to switch to development or design.

# What is this about?

Many material on the internet already covers a lot about how to have a great career as developer or designer. However, I found that most of them comes from US, and sometimes sets unrealistic expectations for people from other continents.

My aim is to share with you stories about my experience of being a software developer and a ux designer in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland, as a person coming from East Europe, Slovakia. I hope it helps you on your journey towards an awesome career.
