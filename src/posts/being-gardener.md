In Switzerland, many firms don't have a clear idea of what to do with UX designers. Compared to project managers, there are few established areas of responsibility and limited opportunities for career growth. While this can be challenging, it can also present an opportunity to define the role of UX designers within the organization.

Initially, I was hesitant to take initiative and focus too much on my own craft. However, as I began to explore the needs of other teams, I discovered a lack of internal design resources. I took the opportunity to engage with these teams, listen to their vision, and offer my support. While not all of my efforts were successful, I was able to create meaningful connections and contribute to the success of other teams.

Transparency was key in sharing my internal networking and project progress with my team. While some may view this as simply a way to earn bonuses and promotions, it's about making the effort we put into our work visible and potentially opening up more doors for growth.

This kind of discovery within the company can be uncomfortable at first, as there are no clear directions and not all discussions will be successful. However, it's important to focus on helping the product team succeed and sharing design knowledge to create something that everyone is happy with. Even if it's not pixel-perfect, it's enough to sustain a usable product.

Being a UX designer can be compared to being a gardener with a fruit garden. While some parts may be maintained by others, there may be areas that need extra attention. By making an effort to create an amazing garden that stands out, we can attract more "bees" and ultimately yield a greater harvest.
